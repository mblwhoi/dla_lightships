File ftpd from NCDC October 1997 via Joe Elms. These data were keyed at
NCDC as part of what he called the &quot;New York Bight Study&quot; led
by Bill Brower (also at NCDC) much of which was merged into COADS data
(&gt;1970). If you need the format for TD-1129 it can be copied off the
web at <BR>

records (rsz=140 - TDF-11 sfc marine) ftpd from NCDC October 1997 via Joe
Elms for the <I><FONT COLOR="#FF6600">period Jan 1961 - Mar 1973</FONT></I>.
These data were also part of&nbsp; the &quot;New York Bight Study&quot;
but the entire period was not merged into COADS data as of 1997.&nbsp;
This file overlaps what is in TD1129 format above. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data collected and keyed at NCDC for the New York
Bight Study were originally placed into the TDF-11 format with a few modifications.
Deviations from the TDF-11 format for this file are that in positions 78-79
in place of the Ocean Weather Station Number (OSV - Ocean Station Vessel)
or Country Code they placed the last two digits of the ship number (e.g.
Ambrose, 0501). Also in position 81 (OSV or ship indicator), a blank, 9,
or 0 appears, the 9 always appears with 1960's data and 0 from the 1970's.
Documentation for the TDF-11 format is not available digitally but I have
separated the fields in the file listed next (<A HREF="lightships_ambrose_amb_tdf11.kle">amb_tdf11.kle)
</A>and have supporting documentation for the data available <A HREF="lightships_meta_data_tdf11_kle_info.html">here</A>.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overpunches occur in this set and generally indicate
a negative value.&nbsp; They are usually an 11 punch over a number which
gets converted to a letter in a printout or for screen viewing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
e.g. a letter J represents a negative value over a 1 , a K =-2, L= -3 ........Q=-8,
and&nbsp; R = -9.&nbsp; An 11 punch over a 0 is generally not converted
and what you see is a blank character, sometimes it appears as a left-handed
brace (you may have to examine these punches in hex to see what was actually
punched). </P>
